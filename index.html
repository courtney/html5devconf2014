						The purpose of this talk is two fold. 
						<br/>The first objective is to outline the basic fundamental of animation and how to put it into practice.
						<p>The meta purpose of this talk to to attempt to bridge the gap between developers and designers.</p> 
						<p>How many of you consider yourselves a designer? Developer? Hybrid?</p>
						<p>Designing animations for software has always been a bit decoupled from the implementation.<br/>
						translating that onto web or mobile is always a bit tricky.</p> 
						<p>Developers can also benefit by understanding some of the basic principles behind animation design so they can add in some interesting elements to their interface designs</p>

						<p>Windsor McCay working at disney, came up with a way to create cartoon animations</p>

						<p>Traditional disney animation consisted of the best designers creating a few key animation drawings and then a "inbetweener" would draw in the scenes between. This is where keyframe and tween came to be. </p>

						<p>We use software to be the "inbetweener".</p>
						
						<p>So instead of a human determining tbe direction and speed that this figure flips, we've can use math to actually create very organic and natural animations from one state to the next.</p>

						<p>Things have understood physical properties which we can intuit to mean certain things. this is affordance.</p>
						<p>In much the same way, user interfaces can naturally lead people to take the correct steps to accomplish their goals.. this is a signifier or perceived affordance: The concept of affordance derives from cognitive psychology and refers to particular characteristics of an object that guide the viewer.

			<h2>The basics of animation: interpolation</h2>
			<!-- <p>Start, Change, Time, Duration</p> -->
			<pre>valueAtTime = (end - start) * time / duration + start</pre>
			<aside class="notes">
				<p>One simple formula describes all animation. <p>
				
				<p>Once you understand this, you can manipulate your animation without limit.</p>
				
				<p>It is all based on time. You need to know where you are going to start, where you want to go (change), where you are currently, and what the total duration should be for the animation</p>
			</aside>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Breaking it down to [0-1]</h2>		
			<pre>valueAtTime = (end - start) * time / duration + start</pre>	
			<p>change = end - start</p>			
			<p>percent complete = time/duration</p>
			<aside class="notes">
				<p>when making some kind of animation, we know the starting and ending positions, and want to transition between these. All of these can be converted to interpolation from 0 to 1.</p>

				- thinking about things in terms of percent complete
				<p>you are trying to map everything into a point of reference between 0 and 1</p>
				<p>multiply any value between 0 and 1 with another value between 0 and 1, and the result is guaranteed to be between 0 and 1.</p>
				this will then work for everything - you will have your different parameters like position, color, shape, etc but you can map them to a value between 0 to 1
				
				<p>So Interpolation allows you to start talking more generally and easily porting over whatever you need to put motion to into a very easy range of reference.</p>

		<aside class="notes">
			I keep talking about this magical 0-1 range... but now we're going to step outside that.
			Being able to go beyond the range prescribed by your property's initial value and final value is a very important detail that can help make your animations more realistic! One of the 12 Basic Principles of Animation is Follow through or elastic movement. Follow through refers to an animation technique where things don't stop animating suddenly. They exceed their final target slightly before snapping back into place. This useful technique is something that can only be done by going beyond the 0-1 range.

			So you can see that when animations start to get complicated, the math does start to get a bit more complicated as well. It is worthwhile to take the opportunity to play around with it but there are also lots of options out there to take care of it for you as well. Given the basic knowledge you have now, you can understand better what is going on under the hood.

			Animating in JavaScript does give you a lot of control: starting, pausing, reversing, interrupting and cancelling are trivial. Some effects, like parallax scrolling, can only be achieved in JavaScript.

			<p>As far as performance, there is a lot to consider before you can just say CSS is better than JS.

		<h2>Go forth and animate!</h2>
		<aside class="notes">
			So I'd like to encourage you all to go out and play with animations and with these formulas. See what you can do with just an HTML page and some simple JS functions. Play around with the values and find out what types of animations appeal to you.
